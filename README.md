# Kubernetes Setup and Configuration Guide

> **Important Notes:**
> 1. It is recommended to perform these configurations on a **Debian-based system** (e.g., Debian or Ubuntu) for the best compatibility and performance.  
    - You can download the latest Debian Net Install ISO from [here](https://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/current/amd64/iso-cd/debian-12.8.0-amd64-netinst.iso).
> 2. When setting up a Kubernetes cluster, ensure that you configure at least one **Master Node** and one or more **Worker Nodes**. This is essential for a functional cluster where the Master Node manages the cluster and Worker Nodes handle workloads.

Welcome to this repository! Here, you'll find a comprehensive guide to setting up and configuring a Kubernetes cluster from scratch, along with additional features such as load balancing, ingress controllers, and SSL certificate management. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced engineer, this repository will guide you through every step of the process.

## Overview

Kubernetes is a powerful tool for container orchestration, but setting it up correctly can be a daunting task. This repository breaks down the process into manageable steps, with clear instructions and practical configurations. Below is a brief summary of the steps involved:

1. **Set Up the Kubernetes Environment**:
    - Install and configure essential components like `containerd`, `kubelet`, and `kubectl`.
    - Prepare your system by enabling necessary kernel modules and configuring networking.
    - Learn more in [**Install Kubernetes**](install-k8s.md).

2. **Create and Manage Clusters**:
    - Initialize a Kubernetes cluster using `kubeadm`.
    - Set up a network plugin (Flannel) for pod communication.
    - Easily reset or remove clusters when needed.
    - For detailed instructions, visit [**Create and Remove Cluster**](create-cluster.md).

3. **Set Up Load Balancing with MetalLB**:
    - Deploy MetalLB, a load balancer solution for bare-metal Kubernetes clusters.
    - Configure IP address pools and ensure smooth traffic distribution.
    - Follow the guide in [**Install MetalLB**](install-metallb.md).

4. **Configure Ingress Controllers**:
    - Use NGINX Ingress Controller to manage external access to services in your cluster.
    - Set up ingress resources for your applications.
    - Details are included in [**Install MetalLB**](install-metallb.md).

5. **Enable HTTPS with SSL Certificates**:
    - Install and configure `cert-manager` for automatic SSL certificate provisioning.
    - Secure your applications using Let's Encrypt certificates.
    - Learn how in [**Install SSL Certificates**](install-ssl.md).

## How to Get Started

To get started, simply navigate to the relevant file based on what you're trying to achieve. Each file contains step-by-step instructions tailored to a specific part of the setup process. Follow the links below to access the guides:

## Notes and Best Practices

- Ensure you follow the steps in the recommended order for a seamless setup experience.
- Double-check system requirements and prerequisites before starting.
- Always test your setup in a staging environment before deploying it to production.
